To whom it may concern,

At Demant, managing over 3,500 clinics requires well-thought-out data management solutions that are carefully and continuously implemented. As a data engineer with experience in PostgreSQL, Azure, and Python, I have designed custom ETL pipelines for OEM telematics. My background as an academic researcher, combined with my recent experience at a Danish startup, has equipped me with the skills to quickly integrate into Demant's Data Intelligence Team. I am ready to contribute to ongoing coding and database projects that support Demant's clinics and business goals.

During my academic career, I collaborated with a multinational team on the Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) Experiment at CERN. There, I developed machine learning algorithms to analyze large-scale datasets, creating predictive models to isolate specific decay events from kinematics data. I utilized tools such as neural networks, decision trees, and ML libraries like XGBoost, TensorFlow, and Keras. Although these tools were new to me at the time, I demonstrated my ability to rapidly learn and adapt to unfamiliar technologiesâ€”a skill I am confident will serve me well at Demant.

At Wolfram Research, I taught the Wolfram Language and mentored university students on data-intensive projects spanning financial modeling, statistical analysis, and machine learning applications. These projects covered diverse fields, including business analysis, mathematics, finance, and chemistry, honing my ability to quickly grasp new domains and communicate insights effectively to both technical and non-technical stakeholders. I managed these projects using SCRUM methodologies, ensuring proper timelines and accountability. This experience has prepared me to seamlessly integrate into existing teams and contribute to ongoing and new database and analysis projects.

Most recently, as a Data Engineer at Uptimus, a Danish startup specializing in last-mile delivery optimization for clients like Bring and Nemlig, I designed data-streaming and integration solutions for an ETL pipeline. My work involved mapping data from various vehicle makes and models to Uptimus' internal tracking system. I developed production-ready Python scripts and incorporated tools such as Docker, Azure, PostgreSQL, and GitHub while strengthening my proficiency in core data transformation libraries like pandas, NumPy, and SciPy.

Although my previous roles were not explicitly titled "Data Engineer," I was consistently building the skills and tools that form a strong foundation to succeed at Demant. I am confident that my technical expertise, adaptability, and collaborative approach will enable me to make meaningful contributions to your team. I am happy to provide references, including my supervisor at Uptimus, who can speak to my technical abilities and work ethic. Please feel free to contact me via phone or email to discuss my application or arrange an interview. I look forward to the opportunity to contribute to Demant's success.
