To whom it may concern,

At HelloFresh, minimizing food waste and enhancing customer experiences through recipe management are critical priorities. These goals rely on extracting actionable insights from customer data and maintaining diligent data management practices. My background as an academic researcher and, more recently, as a data engineer at a Danish startup has equipped me with the skills and experience to quickly integrate into HelloFresh Nordic’s Operations Tech Team and contribute to ongoing coding and database projects.

During my academic career, I collaborated with a multinational team on the Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) Experiment at CERN. There, I developed machine learning algorithms to analyze large-scale datasets, creating predictive models to isolate specific decay events from kinematics data. I utilized tools such as neural networks, decision trees, and ML libraries like XGBoost, TensorFlow, and Keras. Although these tools were new to me at the time, I demonstrated my ability to rapidly learn and adapt to unfamiliar technologies—a skill I am confident will serve me well at HelloFresh.

At Wolfram Research, I taught the Wolfram Language and mentored university students on data-intensive projects spanning financial modeling, statistical analysis, and machine learning applications. These projects covered diverse fields, including business analysis, mathematics, finance, and chemistry, honing my ability to quickly grasp new domains and communicate insights effectively to both technical and non-technical stakeholders. I managed these projects using SCRUM methodologies, ensuring proper timelines and accountability. This experience has prepared me to seamlessly integrate into existing teams and contribute to ongoing and new database and analysis projects.

Most recently, as a Data Engineer at Uptimus, a Danish startup specializing in last-mile delivery optimization for clients like Bring and Nemlig, I designed data-streaming and integration solutions for an ETL pipeline. My work involved mapping data from various vehicle makes and models to Uptimus' internal tracking system. I developed production-ready scripts using tools such as Docker, Azure, PostgreSQL, GitHub, and QGIS, while strengthening my proficiency in core Python libraries like pandas, NumPy, GeoPandas, and SciPy. At HelloFresh, I am eager to apply these skills to support ongoing projects, manage databases, and collaborate with both technical and non-technical colleagues.

I am excited by the opportunity to join a team at HelloFresh where I can quickly contribute alongside like-minded colleagues. The company's commitment to growth and its mission to help customers eat better resonate deeply with me. I am confident that my technical expertise, adaptability, and collaborative approach will enable me to make meaningful contributions to your team.

I am happy to provide references, including my supervisor at Uptimus, who can speak to my technical abilities and work ethic. Please feel free to contact me via phone or email to discuss my application or arrange an interview. I look forward to the opportunity to contribute to HelloFresh’s success.
