To whom it may concern,

MAN is on the forefront of powered transportation, power generation and green technologies like carbon capture. I hope to utilize my STEM background coming from Florida Tech and working as a data engineer at a danish start up providing data support for managing technical and telematic data from vessels, powerplants and any other MAN projects. I hope to work in field with data that has a real, verifiable and positive impact to society. I hope to find at MAN a place where I can grow my skills and be a part of a team of like-minded individuals who are passionate about their work and the impact it has on the world. 

During my academic career, I collaborated with a multinational team on the Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) Experiment at CERN. As an undergraduate, I designed testing PCBs to verify the functionality of calorimeters before their installation in CMS. This work culminated in a five-year process, and the equipment I helped calibrate is still in use today. After completing my undergraduate degree, I refined my scientific programming skills by developing machine learning algorithms to analyze particle data and identify hadronic top quark decays. This application required a deep understanding of machine learning, data analysis techniques, AI/ML methods and how they can be applied efficiently and effectively to large datasets.

At Wolfram Research, I taught the Wolfram Language and mentored university students on data-intensive projects, including chemistry, quantum computing, and machine learning applications. During my time at Wolfram, I refined my ability to conduct quick and thorough research on both familiar and entirely new topics. I led Master's and PhD students in writing academic-style public posts on Wolfram's Community for professionals, other academics, and enthusiasts. I am always ready to communicate with technical and non-technical stakeholders, and I have strong ability to independently verify data and results programatically and categorically.

Most recently, as a Data Engineer at Uptimus, a Danish startup specializing in last-mile delivery optimization for clients like Bring and Nemlig, I designed data-streaming and integration solutions for an ETL pipeline. In this role, I honed my practical development skills by writing and documenting production-ready Python scripts. I also utilized tools such as Docker, Azure, PostgreSQL, and GitHub while strengthening my proficiency in core data transformation libraries like pandas, NumPy, and SciPy. I have refined my ability with data visualization libraries like Matplotlib, Seaborn and with other programs like PowerBI. I am ready to continue my growth in data engineering and data science, and I am eager to apply my skills to real-world problems.

I hope that MAN can provide me an opportunity to grow and apply my skills in a practical setting and working as a data engineer supporting a real industry making an impact in today's society. I can provide references, including my supervisor at Uptimus, who can speak to my technical abilities and work ethic. Please feel free to contact me via phone or email to discuss my background or to arrange an interview.
