To whom it may concern,

I am writing to express my strong interest in joining KPMG's Challenger Academy as a Data Engineer. My academic background in experimental particle physics, combined with hands-on experience at a data-driven startup in Denmark, has prepared me to contribute effectively to a team of curious, driven, and like-minded professionals. I have ample academic research experience and project management at my previous positions, I hope to pivot into a career as a Data Engineer now, KPMG is providing the perfect opportunity for growth and to contribute my colleagues and workplace.

During my studies, I collaborated with a multinational team on the Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) Experiment at CERN, where I developed machine learning algorithms to analyze large-scale datasets. My work involved creating predictive models to isolate specific decay events from kinematics data using neural networks, decision trees, and libraries such as XGBoost, TensorFlow, and Keras. I also designed electronics and supporting software to test the functioning of PCBs, I participated in the total process of design, testing and implementation. These experiences not only honed my Python skills, but also strengthened my ability to manage complex data structures, perform exploratory analysis, and participate in a larger ecosystem of physical and software structures that make up modern companies data pipelines.

In my role at Wolfram Research, I taught Wolfram Language and guided university students on data-intensive projects, including financial modeling, statistical analysis, and machine learning applications. These projects spanned diverse fields such as GIS, mathematics, physics, and chemistry, giving me the adaptability to quickly learn new domains and communicate insights effectively to both technical and non-technical stakeholders. I treated the students' project in a way similar to a SCRUM attempting to maintain proper timelines and accountability. These experiences put me in the perfect position to participate in software developement

Most recently, as a Data Engineer at Uptimus, a Danish startup focused on last-mile delivery optimization, I designed ETL pipelines and data integration solutions using GIT. My work involved preparing production-ready scripts, leveraging tools like Docker, Azure, and PostgreSQL, and applying geospatial analysis with QGIS and Python libraries. With the data streamed from delivery vehicles throughout Sj√¶lland, I developed a keen ability to think on my feet and continuously improve processes. Outside of my work at Uptimus, I have been exploring PowerBI and learning how to effectively work and manage data in the Microsoft ecosystem.

At KPMG, I look forward to contributing to dynamic data streaming pipelines while deepening my expertise in Python and exploring new techniques. I finished my Danish classes at level PD 2.5, and I am able to write professional emails and communications. I have attached references, including my supervisor at Uptimus, who can speak to my technical abilities and work ethic. Please feel free to contact me via phone or email to discuss my application or arrange an interview.

Thank you for considering my application. I am excited about the opportunity to learn and contribute at KPMG's Challenger Academy!
