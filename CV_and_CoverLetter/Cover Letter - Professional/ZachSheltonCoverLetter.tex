I am writing to express my interest in joining Novo Nordisk and contributing to its mission of improving lives through innovative solutions. While I donâ€™t have direct experience in pharmaceuticals, my work in data-driven environments and my academic background in physics have sparked a strong interest in the field. I am eager to learn about Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) and use my analytical skills to support high-quality pharmaceutical production. My ability to understand scientific principles and work with data aligns well with the needs of manufacturing pharmaceutical substances, especially in understanding how chemistry and equipment interact.

During my studies, I worked with a multinational team on the Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) Experiment at CERN, where I developed machine learning algorithms to analyze large datasets. I created predictive models to identify specific decay events using tools like neural networks, decision trees, and libraries such as XGBoost, TensorFlow, and Keras. I also designed electronics and software to test PCBs, taking part in the entire process from design to implementation. These experiences improved my Python skills and taught me how to manage complex data, perform detailed analysis, and extract useful insights. These skills can be applied in monitoring of pharmaceutical processes.

At Wolfram Research, I taught Wolfram Language and guided university students in data-focused projects across areas like finance, GIS, mathematics, physics, and chemistry. I managed these projects using SCRUM-like methods, ensuring deadlines were met and tasks were completed. This experience has prepared me to connect process science to product quality, as I am skilled at turning technical insights into practical solutions and explaining them clearly to both technical and non-technical audiences. My curiosity about how processes affect outcomes fits well with Novo Nordisk's focus on delivering high-quality products.

In my most recent role as a Data Engineer at Uptimus, a Danish startup focused on optimizing last-mile delivery, I designed ETL pipelines and data integration solutions using GIT. I prepared production-ready scripts with tools like Docker, Azure, and PostgreSQL and used QGIS and Python libraries for geospatial analysis. This role taught me to solve complex problems, think on my feet, and continuously improve processes. I used a systematic approach to manage complex geospatial and temporal data preparing me to help tackle challenges in pharmaceutical manufacturing and data analysis.

I am eager to contribute to Novo Nordisk's mission to help patients around the world and look forward to discussing how my background and skills align with your needs. Thank you for considering my application.
