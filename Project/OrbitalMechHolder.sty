\section{Albedo}
Albedo is a measure of reflectivitiy of a surface, everything from apshalt to the Moon have Albedo! Everything reflects some light, our eyes percieve them as color! However, it is important to note here that Albedo has to be specific in astronomy, there are two kinds of Albedo measurements used in Astronomy. Albedo of the Moon is generally .12, however as seen in photos and by naked eye. The moon has craters and highlands showing darker and brighter patches, in average the Albedo is .11. There are many kinds of Albedo, most importantly for Astronomy, Bond Albedo is used. Bond Albedo uses the Sun to and the Phase angle between the body and the Sun combined with the observed light reflected from the Earth or other bodies. It's based on the percieved reflectance of light from the Sun. Bond Albedo is an inherently difficult thing to calculate, but fortunately, the Albedo of the Moon is not changing constantly because it has no atmosphere. In summary: \textbf{The Bond Albedo of the Moon is generally .11(on average across the whole surface), this value will not change as it orbits the Earth.} Refer to NASA's \href{https://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/planetary/factsheet/moonfact.html}{Moon Factsheet}


\section{Brightness}
The Brightness of the Moon covers a few different things, it is a challenge to decide how bright something is, the Sun is brightest in our solar system and the only thing emitting light in our solar system. So all light seen from planets, asteroids and our moon are reflected from the sun. The issue is when comparing the bright objects in the sky, what is zero brightness? If there is no brightness, then the night sky would be black. Since we can see at night we must measure some zero brightness or background brightness. You would call this Apparent Magnitude, this is something that is hard to measure since the Moon, Earth and other bodies are all in motion around the solar system. In a scientific sense, its a measurement of the amount visible light that is emitted from the stellar body, the SI unit is known as Lux or Luminous Flux per unit area. Its a based on a function of the visible luminosity that the human eye sees.

In modern times astronomers Absolute Magnitude; this is a calculated measurement of all electromagenetic radiation flux per unit area if you were observing it from 1 Astronomical Unit(distance from Sun to Earth). Outside of our solar system, 1 parsec(32.6 Lightyears) is used for stars as the distance standard. Using JPL's Horizon system, you can see the upcoming apparent brightness of the Moon(\href{https://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/horizons/app.html#/}{JPL Horizons System}).

The apparent brightness have many practical challenges to measurement like atmospheric scattering and scattered light due to dust in the solar system. \textbf{The Apparent Magnitude can be predicted and forecasted hourly with JPL's Tools.}
\section{Luminosity}
Luminosity is the same measurement of light as brightness, it is dependent on the lunar phase of the moon. See section above for an explanation.
\section{Entropy Value}
The moon doesn't have entropy values, the Moon's motion is dictated by General Reletivity and gravitational attraction.
